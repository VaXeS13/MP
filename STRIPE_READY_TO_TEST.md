## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Application
1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to: **http://localhost:4200**
3. You should see the MP application homepage

### Step 2: Login
- Use your existing test account, or
- Create a new account

### Step 3: Test Payment Flow

#### Option A: Quick Test (Empty Cart Scenario)
1. Browse available booths
2. Select a booth
3. Add to cart
4. Go to cart: http://localhost:4200/cart
5. Click "Checkout"
6. Select payment provider: **Stripe**
7. Select payment method: **Credit/Debit Card**
8. Click "Complete Checkout"

#### Option B: Full Test (Complete Rental)
1. Navigate to booth listings
2. Find an available booth
3. Click "Rent This Booth"
4. Select dates for rental
5. Add to cart
6. Review cart items
7. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
8. Select **Stripe** as payment provider
9. Select **Credit/Debit Card** as method
10. Click "Complete Checkout"
11. You'll be redirected to Stripe Checkout page

### Step 4: Complete Payment on Stripe
On the Stripe Checkout page:

**Test Cards:**
1. **Success Card** (recommended first):
   - Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., `12/30`)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
   - ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., `12345`)

2. **3D Secure Card** (requires authentication):
   - Number: `4000 0025 0000 3155`
   - Follow authentication prompts

3. **Declined Card** (to test failure):
   - Number: `4000 0000 0000 9995`

**Email**: Use any test email (e.g., `test@example.com`)

**Name**: Any test name

Click "Pay" button.

### Step 5: Verify Webhook Received
After payment, check the **Stripe CLI output** (Process ID: 2b7b73):

You should see webhook events like:
```
2025-10-21 09:05:XX   --> checkout.session.completed [evt_xxxxx]
2025-10-21 09:05:XX   <-- [200] POST http://localhost:44377/api/app/payments/stripe/webhook
```

**✅ Good**: Status 200 means webhook was received and processed
**❌ Bad**: Status 400/500 means webhook processing failed

### Step 6: Verify in Application
After successful payment:

1. **Frontend**:
   - You should be redirected to success page
   - Check "My Rentals" section
   - Rental should show as "Paid" status

2. **Backend Logs** (Process ID: 73b428):
   - Look for: `StripeWebhookHandler: Payment confirmed for rental {RentalId}`
   - Look for: `Booth {BoothId} marked as rented`

3. **Database** (optional):
   ```sql
   SELECT TOP 5
       r.Id as RentalId,
       r.Status,
       r.Payment_TotalAmount,
       r.Payment_PaidDate,
       r.Payment_Przelewy24TransactionId as StripeSessionId
   FROM Rentals r
   WHERE r.Payment_Przelewy24TransactionId LIKE 'cs_%'
   ORDER BY r.CreationTime DESC;
   ```

4. **Stripe Dashboard**:
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments
   - You should see your test payment

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators

**Frontend:**
- Redirect to Stripe Checkout page works
- After payment, redirect back to success page
- Rental appears in "My Rentals"
- Rental status shows as "Paid"
- Booth status changes to "Rented"

**Backend API Logs:**
```
[09:0X:XX INF] StripeWebhookHandler: Verified webhook event {EventId} of type checkout.session.completed
[09:0X:XX INF] StripeWebhookHandler: Payment confirmed for rental {RentalId}. Booth {BoothId} marked as rented.
```

**Stripe CLI:**
```
--> checkout.session.completed [evt_xxxxx]
<-- [200] POST http://localhost:44377/api/app/payments/stripe/webhook
```

**Stripe Dashboard:**
- Payment appears with status "Succeeded"
- Amount matches rental price
- Metadata contains: `session_id`, `merchant_id`, `tenant_id`

### ❌ Failure Indicators

**Frontend:**
- Error message during checkout
- Stuck on loading screen
- No redirect to Stripe

**Backend API Logs:**
```
[ERR] StripeWebhookHandler: Amount mismatch for session {SessionId}
[ERR] StripeProvider: Stripe is not configured
[WRN] StripeWebhookHandler: Webhook secret not configured
```

**Stripe CLI:**
```
<-- [400] POST http://localhost:44377/api/app/payments/stripe/webhook
<-- [500] POST http://localhost:44377/api/app/payments/stripe/webhook
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Stripe provider is not configured"
**Solution**:
1. Check `appsettings.json` has correct keys
2. Restart backend API
3. Verify settings in database (if configured there)

### Problem: "Webhook processing failed"
**Check**:
1. Is Stripe CLI still running? (Process 2b7b73)
2. Is webhook secret correct in appsettings.json?
3. Check backend API logs for errors

### Problem: "Amount mismatch" in logs
**Cause**: Cart total changed between checkout and payment
**Solution**: Clear cart and try again

### Problem: Payment succeeds but rental not marked as paid
**Check**:
1. Webhook received? (Check Stripe CLI output)
2. Backend API logs for errors
3. Database - is rental created?

### Problem: Stripe Checkout page doesn't open
**Check**:
1. Browser console for errors (F12)
2. Network tab - check API response
3. Backend API logs for payment creation errors

## 📊 Monitoring Commands

### Check Stripe CLI Output
```powershell
# In a new PowerShell window
"/c/Users/vaxes/.stripe/bin/stripe.exe" logs tail
```

### Check Backend API Logs
View the console output of Process ID: 73b428
Or check file: `src/MP.HttpApi.Host/Logs/logs.txt`

### Check Recent Stripe Payments
```sql
SELECT TOP 10
    PaymentIntentId,
    Amount,
    Currency,
    Status,
    CompletedAt,
    CreationTime
FROM StripeTransactions
ORDER BY CreationTime DESC;
```

### Check Recent Rentals

## 🎯 Expected Flow Sequence

1. **User adds booth to cart** → Cart created (Status: Active)
2. **User clicks checkout** → Rentals created (Status: Draft)
3. **User selects Stripe** → Nothing happens yet
4. **User clicks "Complete Checkout"** →
   - Backend calls Stripe API
   - Creates Checkout Session
   - Returns session URL to frontend
5. **Frontend redirects** → User sees Stripe Checkout page
6. **User enters card details** → Stripe processes payment
7. **Payment succeeds** → Stripe sends webhook to backend
8. **Webhook received** →
   - Backend verifies signature
   - Finds rentals by session ID
   - Verifies amount
   - Marks rentals as paid
   - Changes booth status to Rented
   - Registers promotion usage (if applicable)
   - Returns 200 OK
9. **User redirected back** → Success page shown
10. **User sees rental** → "My Rentals" shows paid rental

**Total time**: ~5-10 seconds from "Complete Checkout" to "Success"
